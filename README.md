### PaperSage
Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

Prerequisites
Python 3.8 or higher
Django 4.0 or higher
OpenAI API Key (for GPT)
LangChain (for seamless integration of the RAG model)
PostgreSQL or SQLite (for database)
Installation
Clone the repository
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/papersage.git
cd papersage
Create and activate a virtual environment
bash
Copy code
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
Install dependencies
bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Make sure to include necessary libraries in the requirements.txt:

arduino
Copy code
Django>=4.0
openai
langchain
djangorestframework
psycopg2 (if using PostgreSQL)
Set up environment variables
Create a .env file in the project root and add your OpenAI API Key and other relevant configurations:

makefile
Copy code
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
DJANGO_SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
DEBUG=True
DATABASE_URL=your_database_url (if using PostgreSQL)
Run migrations
bash
Copy code
python manage.py migrate
Create a superuser (to access the Django admin)
bash
Copy code
python manage.py createsuperuser
Run the development server
bash
Copy code

Usage
Selecting Papers: Users can upload or select research papers from a list. These papers will be used as context for the chat interface.

Chat Interface: Users can type questions or prompts, and the AI (powered by GPT and RAG) will respond with insights, summaries, and explanations based on the selected papers.

Conversation History: Users can revisit previous conversations to continue or review earlier discussions.

Technologies Used
Django: Web framework to handle backend and frontend templates.
GPT & LangChain: For AI-powered conversation and document analysis using a RAG model.
PostgreSQL: Primary database (optional, can be replaced with SQLite).
HTML/CSS/JS: For the frontend interface.
Future Improvements
Multi-user Support: Add functionality for multiple users to access their own chat history.
Paper Summarization: Automatic summaries of research papers before starting a conversation.
Real-Time Updates: Implement WebSocket or other real-time features for smoother interactions.
Advanced Querying: Support for more complex, multi-document queries for paper reviews.
